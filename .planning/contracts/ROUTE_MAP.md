## Homepage snap slides (live)

| # | Slide id | Content |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | `video` | Full-bleed hero video (`site/media.json`) |
| 2 | `activities` | Launch / Missions / StagWorks from `getActivityNavGroups()` |
| 3 | `achievements` | `awards.json` |
| 4 | `sponsors` | Sponsors list or partner CTA if empty |
| 5 | `connect` | Member Zone + Contact |

Controls: ↑/↓, dots, wheel threshold, arrow keys. Site footer hidden on home.

## Chrome rules

| Rule | Spec |
|------|------|
| Menu | Left burger; drawer portaled to `document.body` |
| Header | Transparent + `backdrop-filter` blur (colourless frost) |
| Home | **Logo** in header bar links `/` (text Home control removed by design) |
| Ethos | Under About (`#ethos`), not homepage hero |
| Activities IA | Same grouping as burger: Launch, Missions, StagWorks |
| Multi-year comps | Year children in hover/focus flyout (nav + home); hub pages still list years |
| Courses | Member Zone, not StagWorks primary |
| Incomplete comps/years | `comingSoon`: greyed; “Coming soon” on hover |
| Sponsors | Empty JSON ⇒ omit from nav; home sponsors slide still shows CTA |
| Member Zone | Public; no auth |
| Style | Interim `--ps-*` tokens; shell 1600 / content 1400 — see STYLE_SYSTEM.md |

## Nav item status

```ts
type NavItemStatus = "live" | "comingSoon";
// comingSoon ⇒ muted + “Coming soon” tip; href optional/ignored
```

## Legacy aliases (structured)

| Old scrape slug | Serves |
|-----------------|--------|
| `/contact` | `/contact-us` |
| `/nrc-2` | `/nationalrocketry` hub |
| `/competitions` | `/mach/2022-2023` |
| `/draft-mach-x` | `/mach/2023-2024` |
| `/draft-nrc-2023-2024` | `/nationalrocketry/2023-2024` |
| `/draft-race2space` | `/race2space` |
| `/draft-ukseds-in-orbit-servicing-and-manufacturing` | `/ukseds-in-orbit-servicing-and-manufacturing` |
| `/committee-2023-2024-copy` | `/committee-2025-2026` |

## Fallback scrape routes

Unmigrated junk/stubs still served from `pages.json` (hello-world, about-2, category/*, satellite, LinkedIn widget, dated blog). Structured JSON / mission hubs override same slugs.
